# Discordbot

This is My Personal Discord Bot called JTBot. He was written in JS and was given the ability to give 
info about my classmates while also giving you a link to the Greatest Movie Script of all time.

He will be given more functionality in the future.

What I used to code this Bot:
- JavaScript/Node.js: This is what I used to code the backend of my bot.
- npm: A Regestry where I was able to install packages made by discord so the functionality I coded would work on Discord.
